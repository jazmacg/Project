    <h3>Cognitive Behavioral Therapy</h3>
    <p>
    Behavioural and cognitive therapies are based on the way you think (cognitive) and/or the way you behave. These therapies recognise that it is possible to change, or recondition, our thoughts or behaviour to overcome specific problems. The therapy aims to break overwhelming problems down into smaller parts to make them easier to cope with. During the treatment you and your therapist will focus on the here and now, while noting how past events shaped your thinking/behaviours.
    <br>
    As a therapy, it acknowledges that there may be behaviors that cannot be controlled through rational thought, but rather emerge based on prior conditioning from the environment and other external and/or internal stimuli. As such, it is problem focused and action oriented. Therapist will provide personalised assistance to the client in selecting appropriate strategies to help address specific problems.

    <h3>Mindfulness-based Cognitive Therapy</h3>
    <p>
    Mindfulness-based cognitive therapy (MBCT) uses traditional cognitive behavioral therapy methods and adds in newer psychological strategies such as mindfulness and mindfulness meditation. Cognitive approaches can include educating the client about depression. Mindfulness and mindfulness meditation, focus on becoming aware of all incoming thoughts and feelings and accepting them, but not attaching or reacting to them.
    <br>
    The goal of this therapy is to interrupt disruptive or harmful automatic processes and teach the participants to focus less on reacting to incoming stimuli, and instead accepting and observing them without judgment.

    <h3>Art Therapy</h3>
    <p>
    This is a creative method of expression used as a therapeutic technique. Art therapy may focus on the creative art-making process itself, as therapy, or on the analysis of expression gained through a one-on-one interaction with the therapist. The psychoanalytic approach employs the transference process between the therapist and the client who makes art. The therapist interprets the client's symbolic self-expression as communicated in the art and elicits interpretations from the client.
    <br>
    Using their evaluative and psychotherapy skills, art therapists choose materials and interventions appropriate to their clients’ needs and design sessions to achieve therapeutic goals and objectives. They use the creative process to help their clients increase insight, cope with stress, work through traumatic experiences, increase cognitive, memory and neurosensory abilities, improve interpersonal relationships and achieve greater self-fulfillment.

    <h3>Group Therapy</h3>
    <p>
    Psychoanalytic therapy tends to look at experiences from early childhood to see if these events have affected the individual’s life, or potentially contributed to current concerns. This form of therapy is considered a long-term choice and can continue for weeks, months or even years depending on the depth of the concern being explored. Psychoanalytic therapy is insight driven and therefore looks to foster change by helping you to understand your past and how events from your early life could be affecting you now. Differing from several other therapy types, psychoanalytic therapy aims to make deep-seated changes in personality and emotional development.
    <br>
    Sessions will vary according to where you are in the course of your therapy, but much of the time will be spent talking freely to your therapist in a safe, non-judgmental environment. The psychoanalyst will listen to your concerns and look out for patterns or certain events that may hold significance. In this type of therapy it is believed that unconscious feelings and childhood events play a key role in mental distress. As well as listening to you discuss your experiences, your therapist may use other techniques to help identify potential causes for your concerns.
