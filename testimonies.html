    <p>Couldn't have asked for a better therapist! Dr. __ made me feel welcome and calm from the moment I stepped into her office, and she was a great help. Thanks to her, my social anxiety is finally under control and I finally feel like myself again. A huge thank you to everyone at the Happy Sunshine, keep up the good work!</p>

    <p>The thearpy alongside the expert doctor who advised on different prescriptions was excellent. Have gone from not leaving my house to being able to go to the shops and socialise with the outside world all due to the support of the happy sunshine councelling service. Thank you for getting me back to me!
